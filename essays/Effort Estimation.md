## How did you make your effort estimates?

I made my effort estimates based on previous assignments and tasks I had worked on. For example, in the WOD exercise assignment, I noticed that each branch of the task typically took between 30 minutes to 45 minutes to complete. Based on that experience, I assumed that similar tasks in my current project would take the same amount of time. For instance, when working on tasks like adding the change password page or fixing the mobile layout, I estimated that they would take around the same time, between 30 minutes to 1 hour per branch of the task. However, some tasks ended up taking longer than expected due to unexpected challenges or additional steps that came up during the process.

## Even though your estimates were always off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates in advance?

One key benefit was that it helped with planning and prioritization. Even though my time predictions werenâ€™t always accurate, making an effort estimate allowed me to break tasks down and allocate time for each part. This helped me stay organized and gave me a general idea of what I could accomplished.


## Was there any benefit to tracking the actual effort spent on issues?

One benefit was that it allowed me to keep my teammates informed. If I was behind on a task, like when I was working on the change password page, I could update them on the actual time spent and let them know how much longer I expected to take. This made collaboration smoother, as my teammates could reassess their own priorities and work on other issues while I finished up.

## How did you track your actual effort? How accurate was it?

I would check the time before starting and after finishing a task, then later report it to my teammate, who keeps track of our records in a spreadsheet. I tried to only count the time I was actually working, so I think it was mostly accurate maybe around 90-95% of the time. While I didn't use a specific time-tracking tool, this method gave me a clear idea of how long each task took and helped me stay on top of my progress.

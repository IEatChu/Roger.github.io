## Introduction: First Impressions of TypeScript

So far, I think TypeScript is pretty interesting. It makes the code a bit easier to read because it adds types, which helps me understand what kind of data I’m working with. But I still have some trouble with the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript. JavaScript feels easier for me because it has many things that are similar to other programming languages, like loops, functions, and conditionals. TypeScript feels more complicated right now, and I’m still learning how to use it properly. 

## Learning New Features with ES6 and TypeScript

I definitely learned a lot of new things, especially about modern JavaScript with ES6. There are so many new features, like arrow functions, template literals, and Promise with resolve and reject
. Sometimes it’s hard to keep up because there’s a lot to take in, but I feel like I’m getting better at understanding how these work, especially when I use them in TypeScript. But since I'm still a beginner, I can’t say if TypeScript is good or bad yet. I just need more time to figure that out.

## Reflecting on the "Athletic Software Engineering" Approach

About the "athletic software engineering" style with the WODs (Workouts of the Day), I didn’t find them very helpful. The time limits made me feel stressed, and I think the pressure to finish quickly didn’t help me learn at all. I prefer when the professor explains things step by step because that helps me understand better. For me, this fast-paced style of learning doesn’t really work.

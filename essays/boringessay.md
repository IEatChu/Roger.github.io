## Introduction: First Impressions of TypeScript

So far, I find TypeScript pretty interesting. It makes code easier to read by adding types, which helps me understand what kind of data I’m working with. However, I still have some trouble remembering the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript. JavaScript feels easier to me because it shares many similarities with other programming languages, like loops, functions, and conditionals. On the other hand, TypeScript feels more complicated right now, and I’m still learning how to use it properly.

## Learning New Features with ES6 and TypeScript

I’ve definitely learned a lot of new things, especially about modern JavaScript with ES6. There are so many new features, like arrow functions, template literals, and async/await. Sometimes it’s hard to keep up because there’s so much to absorb, but I feel like I’m getting better at understanding how these features work, especially when using them in TypeScript. Since I’m still a beginner, though, I can’t say if TypeScript is good or bad just yet. I need more time and practice to figure that out.

## Reflecting on the "Athletic Software Engineering" Approach

As for the "athletic software engineering" approach with the Workouts of the Day (WODs), I didn’t find them very helpful. The time limits made me feel stressed, and the pressure to finish quickly didn’t really help me learn. I prefer when the professor explains things step by step because that helps me understand better. For me, this fast-paced learning style isn’t as effective.

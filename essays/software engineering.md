## My Interest in Software Engineering

I am interested in software engineering because it is needed to create AAA games, like open-world games such as Grand Theft Auto and PUBG. These games have big, interactive worlds that let players explore and make their own choices. In order to create games like this, I need to learn software engineering, as it involves writing the code that makes everything work. I am excited to learn more and gain the skills I need to build these types of games.

## Skills I Want to Improve

I know the basics of several programming languages, including Java, Python, C, and C++, through FreeCodeCamp tutorials. However, I am not yet fully confident in using them.t. My goal is to deepen my coding skills so I can turn my passion for game design into something real. To do this, I aim to deepen my understanding of how each line of code functions and learn how to write more efficient, effective programs. I hope to gradually build my confidence and improve my problem-solving abilities with code.

## Experiences I Hope to Develop

In the future, I want to work on real projects and collaborate with other people. Working with a team is very important in software engineering, and I hope to improve my communication skills and learn how to work together to solve problems. I believe that by collaborating with others, I can learn a lot about software development and how to improve my skills.

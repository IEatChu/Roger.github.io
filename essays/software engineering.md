## Passion for Game Design and the Need for Software Engineering

I’ve always loved the idea of designing games, especially big, open-world ones like Grand Theft Auto and PUBG. The ability to create immersive worlds where players can explore and make choices is something I find exciting. However, I know that to create these kinds of games, I need stronger coding skills, and that’s why I want to focus on learning more about software engineering.

## Skills I Hope to Develop

In the future, I hope to develop deeper skills in C and C++, particularly in writing more efficient and organized code. I want to understand how each line of code works and improve my problem-solving abilities by learning about algorithms and data structures. These are essential skills for building complex, high-performance games. I also want to gain hands-on experience with game engines, like Unity or Unreal Engine, to understand how they work and how to use them to bring my game ideas to life.

## Gaining Practical Experience and Collaboration

Additionally, I plan to work on small projects and collaborate with others to get feedback and learn new ways to solve problems. Working with other developers will be a great way to improve my skills and learn faster. Overall, my goal is to deepen my technical knowledge in coding and game development to create the kinds of games I’ve always dreamed of.

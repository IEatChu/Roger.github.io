## My Interest in Software Engineering

I am interested in software engineering because it is needed to create AAA games, like open-world games such as Grand Theft Auto and PUBG. These games have big, interactive worlds that let players explore and make their own choices. In order to create games like this, I need to learn software engineering, as it involves writing the code that makes everything work. I am excited to learn more and gain the skills I need to build these types of games.

## Skills I Want to Improve

I know the basics of several programming languages, including Java, Python, C, and C++, but I am not confident using them yet. I have only taken tutorials, and I want to practice more so that I can become better at writing code. I aim to improve my skills in these languages and understand how each line of code works. I want to improve at solving problems with code and writing more efficient programs. 

## Experiences I Hope to Develop

In the future, I want to work on real projects and collaborate with other people. Working with a team is very important in software engineering, and I hope to improve my communication skills and learn how to work together to solve problems. I believe that by collaborating with others, I can learn a lot about software development and how to improve my skills.

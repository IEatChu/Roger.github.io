In this project, I created a flyer for the Honolulu Community College Computer Lab to promote the various services available to UH students. The flyer highlights key offerings such as the laptop loan-out program, free printing services, and tech support. These resources are designed to assist students with their academic needs and provide convenient access to technology. The flyer aims to inform students about the labâ€™s services and encourage them to take full advantage of the tools and support available to help them succeed at HCC.

### My Contributions to the Study Palz Project

For the Study Palz project, my team and I built a website for ICS students at UH Mānoa to organize in-person study groups. The goal was to help students connect with classmates, find study buddies, and meet up in ICSpace to work together. We also added fun features like points and leaderboards to encourage participation. I worked on many different parts of the site and learned a lot from the whole experience.

### What I Worked On

I built the home page, navbar, and footer to make the layout clean and easy to use. I also worked on the profile page, where users can add their name, classes, and upload a profile picture. Once the picture is saved, it shows as their icon on the home page.

I created the change password page and added bounce-in animations to the sign-in, sign-up, and change password pages to make everything feel smooth and modern.

I also helped with the leaderboard and calendar pages. While I wasn’t fully in charge of those parts, I gave feedback and made small changes to make sure they fit with the rest of the site. I also created the About and Contact pages to explain what the site is about and how people can reach us.

### Deployment and Design

I helped deploy the website to Vercel and set up environment variables for both development and production. This made sure the site worked correctly in different stages. I also designed the Study Palz logo, which gave the site a unique and fun look.

### Documentation and Teamwork

I helped write and edit the index.md file that explains what Study Palz is and how to use it. This made the site easier for others to understand, whether they are students using the site or developers looking at the code. I also helped create a GitHub project board where we assigned tasks to each team member, which helped us stay organized and on track.

### What I Learned

This project helped me grow as a developer and a teammate. I got hands-on experience with Next.js, Prisma, Vercel, and GitHub. I learned how to build user-friendly pages, manage environment settings, and work with others on a real website.

I also learned the value of teamwork and communication. Using GitHub Issues and a shared task board made it easier to stay organized and work smoothly together. Writing clear documentation also showed me how important it is to explain your work in a way others can follow.

### My Contributions to Study Palz

For the **Study Palz** project, my team and I created a website for ICS students at UH Mānoa to organize and join in-person study groups. The goal was to help students connect with classmates, find study partners, and meet up in ICSpace to collaborate. To make the experience more engaging, we also incorporated fun features like points and leaderboards. My contributions spanned both front-end and back-end development, and I learned a lot throughout the process.

### Key Areas I Worked On

#### Front-End Development

- **Home Page, Navbar, and Footer:** I designed and built the main layout, ensuring that navigation was intuitive and easy to use.
- **Profile Page:** I worked on the profile page where users can input personal details, add their classes, and upload a profile picture. Once saved, the profile picture is displayed as the user's icon on the home page.
- **Sign-In, Sign-Up, and Change Password Pages:** I added smooth, engaging bounce-in animations to enhance the user experience on these key pages.

#### Collaboration on Other Pages

- **Leaderboard & Calendar Pages:** While I wasn’t fully responsible for these pages, I provided feedback and helped ensure their design and functionality aligned with the overall vision of the site.
- **About and Contact Pages:** I developed these pages to clearly explain the purpose of the site and provide a way for users to contact us.

### Deployment and Design

- **Website Deployment:** I helped deploy Study Palz to Vercel and managed environment variables for both development and production environments, ensuring everything ran smoothly in different stages.
- **Logo Design:** I designed the Study Palz logo to give the site a unique and fun look, helping to create a strong visual identity.

### Documentation and Team Collaboration

- **Documentation:** I assisted in creating and editing the `index.md` file that provides clear information about the site, making it easier for users and developers to understand.
- **GitHub Project Board:** I helped set up and manage a GitHub project board where we assigned tasks to each team member. This organization kept the project on track and allowed us to communicate effectively.

### What I Learned

The Study Palz project was a valuable learning experience in both technical and collaborative aspects of development. Through this project, I:

- Gained hands-on experience with **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **Vercel**, and **GitHub**.
- Learned how to build intuitive user interfaces and manage environment settings across different stages of development.
- Developed an appreciation for the importance of **teamwork** and **clear communication**. Tools like GitHub Issues and the project board helped us stay organized and on track, while clear documentation made our project more user-friendly.

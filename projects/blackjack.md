In this projecct, the game allows the player to try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while competing against the dealer.

Key features of the game include:

- A deck of cards that is shuffled and dealt randomly to both the player and the dealer.
- The player can choose to “hit” (get another card) or “stand” (stop drawing cards).
- The dealer must hit if they have less than 17 and stand if they have 17 or more.
- The game decides the outcome based on who has the higher hand or if they tie.

This project helped me apply what I learned in class. I used programming concepts like functions, loops, and conditionals to create the game. It also allowed me to practice solving problems, like managing different game situations and making sure everything works well.

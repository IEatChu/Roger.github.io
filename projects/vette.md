In my project, I replaced the headlights and taillights on my Corvette with new aftermarket LED lights that have sequential lighting. The old lights worked okay, but they didnâ€™t look very modern or bright. I chose these LED lights because they make my car look better and are safer too. The sequential turn signals light up in an eye-catching way, making it much clearer for other drivers to notice when I am making a turn.
